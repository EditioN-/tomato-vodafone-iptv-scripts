This holds some scripts so we can setup a MEO Internet and IPTV connection with a 
normal "WRT" (Tomato, DD-WRT,..) based router.

Check out the blog post on how to set this up with a Tomato firmware: http://zipleen.blogspot.co.uk/2010/10/howto-setup-netgear-3500l-using-tomato.html

Here's on how to set this up with DD-WRT firmware: http://zipleen.blogspot.co.uk/2010/12/howto-setup-netgear-3500l-or-wrt54gl.html

And here's the generic description on what these scripts are doing, if you want to do this by yourself: http://zipleen.blogspot.co.uk/2010/10/how-to-make-meo-fiber-iptv-service-work.html

If you only want MEO iptv internet connection then check this post: http://zipleen.blogspot.co.uk/2010/10/configuring-pppoe-connection-over-vlan.html  - you only need VLAN and that's it.
